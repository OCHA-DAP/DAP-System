2013-12-24:  AdminResource has a mapping for .../cjtest which I intend to get a regionDictionary for the hardcoded values of the "CameroonTest" dictionary (in the db).
I have successfully gotten the entity by it's code and entity type, but struggling to get the RD using the RD.getRegionDictionaryByFields method I created in the RDDao.
The curatedDataService in AdminResource does not have a RDDao.  Think this might be the key. 

?? what does ctx stand for (xml file names)
?? why not use hibernate criteria rather than hql?
?? Why have the rest.helper classes rather than just putting that in the DAO?  Is it to avoid creating another basic class alongside the others?
?? Why not have a UID for RegionDictionary instead of the composite UID?

2013-12-25: Added RD.delete() method to RDDaoImpl which is called by CDSImpl which is called by AR (through the CDS Interface instead of the CDSIImpl, which seems odd to me) to delete a hardcoded RD from the database.
Next: add a button to the jsp that calls this method, then have the button populate itself from the RDs listed on the page (or just one of them?), then add unique buttons for each RD in the table
